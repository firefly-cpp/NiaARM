class Rule:
    r"""Class representing an association rule.

    Args:
        antecedent (list[Feature]): A list of antecedents of the association rule.
        consequent (list[Feature]): A list of consequents of the association rule.
        fitness (Optional[float]): Fitness value of the association rule.
        transactions (Optional[pandas.DataFrame]): Transactional database.

    Attributes:
        cls.metrics (tuple[str]): List of all available interest measures.
        support: Support is defined on an itemset as the proportion of transactions that contain the attribute :math:`X`.

         :math:`supp(X) = \frac{n_{X}}{|D|},`

         where :math:`|D|` is the number of records in the transactional database.

         For an association rule, support is defined as the support of all the attributes in the rule.

         :math:`supp(X \implies Y) = \frac{n_{XY}}{|D|}`

         **Range:** :math:`[0, 1]`

         2015, URL: https://mhahsler.github.io/arules/docs/measures
        confidence: Confidence of the rule, defined as the proportion of transactions that contain
         the consequent in the set of transactions that contain the antecedent. This proportion is an estimate
         of the probability of seeing the consequent, if the antecedent is present in the transaction.

         :math:`conf(X \implies Y) = \frac{supp(X \implies Y)}{supp(X)}`

         **Range:** :math:`[0, 1]`

         2015, URL: https://mhahsler.github.io/arules/docs/measures
        lift: Lift measures how many times more often the antecedent and the consequent Y
         occur together than expected if they were statistically independent.

         :math:`lift(X \implies Y) = \frac{conf(X \implies Y)}{supp(Y)}`

         **Range:** :math:`[0, \infty]` (1 means independence)

         2015, URL: https://mhahsler.github.io/arules/docs/measures
        coverage: Coverage, also known as antecedent support, is an estimate of the probability that
         the rule applies to a randomly selected transaction. It is the proportion of transactions
         that contain the antecedent.

         :math:`cover(X \implies Y) = supp(X)`

         **Range:** :math:`[0, 1]`

         **Reference:** Michael Hahsler, A Probabilistic Comparison of Commonly Used Interest Measures for Association Rules,
         2015, URL: https://mhahsler.github.io/arules/docs/measures
        rhs_support: Support of the consequent.

         :math:`RHSsupp(X \implies Y) = supp(Y)`

         **Range:** :math:`[0, 1]`

         **Reference:** Michael Hahsler, A Probabilistic Comparison of Commonly Used Interest Measures for Association Rules,
         2015, URL: https://mhahsler.github.io/arules/docs/measures
        conviction: Conviction can be interpreted as the ratio of the expected frequency that the antecedent occurs without
         the consequent.

         :math:`conv(X \implies Y) = \frac{1 - supp(Y)}{1 - conf(X \implies Y)}`

         **Range:** :math:`[0, \infty]` (1 means independence, :math:`\infty` means the rule always holds)

         2015, URL: https://mhahsler.github.io/arules/docs/measures
        inclusion: Inclusion is defined as the ratio between the number of attributes of the rule
         and all attributes in the database.

         :math:`inclusion(X \implies Y) = \frac{|X \cup Y|}{m},`

         where :math:`m` is the total number of attributes in the transactional database.

         Intelligent Systems and Computing, vol 1324. Springer, Cham.
        amplitude: Amplitude measures the quality of a rule, preferring attributes with smaller intervals.

         :math:`ampl(X \implies Y) = 1 - \frac{1}{n}\sum_{k = 1}^{n}{\frac{Ub_k - Lb_k}{max(o_k) - min(o_k)}},`

         where :math:`n` is the total number of attributes in the rule, :math:`Ub_k` and :math:`Lb_k` are upper and lower
         bounds of the selected attribute, and :math:`max(o_k)` and :math:`min(o_k)` are the maximum and minimum
         feasible values of the attribute :math:`o_k` in the transactional database.

         **Range:** :math:`[0, 1]`

         association rule mining. arXiv preprint arXiv:2010.15524 (2020).
        interestingness: Interestingness of the rule, defined as:

         :math:`interest(X \implies Y) = \frac{supp(X \implies Y)}{supp(X)} \cdot \frac{supp(X \implies Y)}{supp(Y)}
         \cdot (1 - \frac{supp(X \implies Y)}{|D|})`

         Here, the first part gives us the probability of generating the rule based on the antecedent, the second part
         gives us the probability of generating the rule based on the consequent and the third part is the probability
         that the rule won't be generated. Thus, rules with very high support will be deemed uninteresting.

         **Range:** :math:`[0, 1]`

         association rule mining. arXiv preprint arXiv:2010.15524 (2020).
        comprehensibility: Comprehensibility of the rule. Rules with fewer attributes in the consequent are more
         comprehensible.

         :math:`comp(X \implies Y) = \frac{log(1 + |Y|)}{log(1 + |X \cup Y|)}`

        netconf: The netconf metric evaluates the interestingness of
         association rules depending on the support of the rule and the
         support of the antecedent and consequent of the rule.

         :math:`netconf(X \implies Y) = \frac{supp(X \implies Y) - supp(X)supp(Y)}{supp(X)(1 - supp(X))}`

         **Range:** :math:`[-1, 1]` (Negative values represent negative dependence, positive values represent positive
         dependence and 0 represents independence)

         doi: 10.1109/UBMYK48245.2019.8965539.
        yulesq: The Yule's Q metric represents the correlation between two possibly related dichotomous events.

         :math:`yulesq(X \implies Y) =
         \frac{supp(X \implies Y)supp(\neg X \implies \neg Y) - supp(X \implies \neg Y)supp(\neg X \implies Y)}
         {supp(X \implies Y)supp(\neg X \implies \neg Y) + supp(X \implies \neg Y)supp(\neg X \implies Y)}`

        zhang: Zheng's metric measures the strength of association (positive or negative) between the antecedent and consequent, taking into account both their co-occurrence and non-co-occurrence.

         :math:`zhang(X \implies Y) =
         \frac{conf(X \implies Y) - conf(\neg X \implies Y)}{max\{conf(X \implies Y), conf(\neg X \implies Y)\}}`

        leverage: difference between the frequency of antecedent and the consequent appearing together and the expected
        frequency of them appearing separately based on their individual support

         :math:`leverage(X \implies Y) = support(X \implies Y) - (support(X) \times support(Y))`
